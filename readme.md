This project is the backend part of the [ContextChat](https://github.com/drodimin/context-chat-ui) , with the following goals:

1. Establish a Proof of Concept for achieving binding to a local file in a web browser setting.
2. Ensure that each message to the Language Learning Model (LLM) automatically includes the latest version of the code.
3. Enable the application of suggestions directly to the code file.

The project aimed to solve a specific problem in code interaction and collaboration. However, since its inception, many new tools have emerged, such as:

- Claude project artifacts
- Cursor
- Other similar technologies

As a result, the problem that this project initially aimed to solve can now be addressed in various alternative ways using these newer tools and technologies.
